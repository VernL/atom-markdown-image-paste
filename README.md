# Atom Markdown Image Paste

> A simple Atom package to paste images into markdown files

## About

This project was created to simplify pasting screenshots into markdown files.

Currently, only files ending with a `.md` extension are supported.

Image files are placed in a `images` subfolder. The image files are named based on the open document and the current time.

- Example:

  - `![](images/README_23-36-38.png)`

  ![](images/README_23-36-38.png)


## Install and usage

Install via apm or from within Atom. Find out about Atom Packages in the [Flight Manual.](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/)

Take a screenshot.

Place your cursor at the desired location and hit `ctrl + shift + V` to paste the image.

Voilà!
