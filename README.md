# Atom Markdown Image Paste

> A simple Atom package to paste images into markdown files

## About

This project was created to simplify taking screenshots and pasting them into markdown files for note takin and was developed to be used with the excellent [Atom Notes])(https://github.com/lexicalunit/atom-notes) package.

Currently, only files ending with a `.md` extension are supported.

Image files are placed in a `images` subfolder. The image files are named based on the open document and the current time.

- Example:
  ![](images/README_23-36-38.png)
