# Atom Markdown Image Paste

> A simple Atom package to paste images into markdown and text files

## About

This project was created to simplify pasting screenshots into markdown and text notes. It is intended to be used along with the (fantastic) atom-notes package. 

Image files are placed in a sub folder named after the current document. All sub folders are contained within an `images` folder. Image files are named based on the the current time.

- Example:

  - `![](images/README/2019-03-24T02-45-09.png)`

  ![](images/README/2019-03-24T02-45-09.png)
  

## Install and usage

Install via apm or from within Atom. Find out about Atom Packages in the [Flight Manual.](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/)

Take a screenshot.

Place your cursor at the desired location and hit `alt + shift + V` to paste the image.

Voilà!
